We were seven seniors at the Lawrenceville School working on a PC game for our spring senior project, with Dr. Keith Voss as our advisor.

Our video game is a [tactical RPG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_role-playing_game) with an emphasis on rich in-game storyline and content. The project itself is written in the Visual C# programming language with the Microsoft XNA 4.0 Game Development Framework.
